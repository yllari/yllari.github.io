<br>0.43 in the error calculation comes from log10(e), but why applied to the extinction error?
<br>Why that formula for the extinction error? 
<br>What is the correct way to estimate error calculation in the MC SFH iteration?
<br>How should maStar models be used? sigma_inst=0 and no other fix?
<br>Why values of EL fitting are negative sometimes? Should they? Because We are using LM method, least square fitting should be bounded either way, but who knows
<br>How should SFH be correlated? should there be any correlation between T30 and T70??
<br>==How come the error in the EL does not depend on the number of pixels in the fitting? Particularly in the continuum<br>
This is from the formula  where  and  is the standard deviation of the residuals for gas-only spectrum  
<br>The program does not ignore very large error values, it fits its either way
<br>There is a latter search of parameters for SSPs for some reason, what are the implications of this
<br>Investigate: Why 3500 factor in mass. This is not used in pyPipe3D
<br>Why only half the sigma noise is used in the gaussian fit? 0.5 for the randomize_flux option

<br>Whenever the EL fit fails is because the EL is outside of the boundaries defined in autossp, this is commonly because the redshift is ill-determined

 <br>To carry out the analysis of Large scale structure effects we use Dominguez-Gómez's sample with the following filters:<br>
<br>Median  &gt; 10
<br>Star-forming galaxy from diagnostic NII-OIII Kauffman diagram
<br>
<br>Petrosian radius 90 &lt; 20 (Dominguez filter, maybe not necessary, but we should control for the<br>
radial O/H and Nitrogen gradient at some point)
<br> in all emission lines used for calibration (either N/O or O/H)<br>
These filters result in a sample with: 593, 826, and 855 galaxies for clusters, filaments,  and  voids with good N/O values.
<br>For this text, I will be using R23-P calibrator from Pilyugin 2001, which constraints the number of galaxies to CLUSTERS: 298, FILAMENTS: 562, VOIDS: 611 (A&amp;A 369, 594–604),<br>
by forcing correct S/N on all necessary lines. I also used the O3N2 and N2 calibrations from Merino+2013, the R23-O23 calibration from Kobulnicky+1999 (analytical expression from the numerical McGaugh+1991) and R23 Tremonti's derived and calibrated O/H. All of these are not shown<br><br>The color-mass distribution is very similar. No mass control will be applied for now.<br>
<img alt="g-r LSS.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/g-r-lss.png"><br>The O/H -N/O distribution (go to Imgs/OH_NO LSS to see it bigger or click if the plugin is activated)  <br><img alt="OH_NO LSS.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/oh_no-lss.png"><br>
The only significant by-eye difference is in the redshift range, as expected because of the CAVITY selection criteria, and some cluster galaxies with low N/O in the high-O/H end. Is this a real thing or an artifact? Under our current paradigm this would mean that cluster galaxies have surprisingly high star formation activities when compared to either filaments or voids.<br>The difference is there when we bin in O/H and plot the mean an std values (as in the following Fig., where the running mean for each environment is also plotted as a continuous line and the colors are the same as in the previous Fig.). BUT, difficult to asses whether if this is statistically significant or not.<br>
<img alt="LSS-median.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/lss-median.png"><br><br>To test the hypothesis that there is a secondary dependence of sSFR for the O/H-N/O relation, we bin in O/H and fit a linear relation O/H-N/O inside. This linear model is substracted to the data in order to obtain some residuals. Finally, the residuals are fitted with the sSFR.  This is not a good parametrization, just a simple test<br>CAVEATS: It could be the case that since whatever we use as a proxy for sSFR (either from MPA, g-r, or fom full spectral fitting) will be correlated with mass, we are only determining the oxygen with<br>
greater precision by adding a secondary parameter. This has to be tested in order to use this exercise as an argument. In the same manner, it could be the case that the calibrator used for the oxygen is sensible to SFR. In that case we run into the exact same problem as before.<br>
Also, R23 is double-valued, and we could be breaking said degeneracy with our secondary parameter.<br>As the sSFR indicator, we will be using the color  provided by SDSS (MPA?), which is highly correlated with the sSFR derived from MPA SFR and log(Mstar):<br>
<img alt="corr_gr_sSFR.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/corr_gr_ssfr.png"><br>For our oxygen calibrator and cluster galaxies, the result for this fitting is shown in blue in the following (left) Fig, as well as the first linear model and the data (in red). ignoring the first two bins, denoted by the vertical blue lines, we see that much of the dispersion in the N/O plane can be characterized with the secondary sSFR parameter.<br>
This can also be seen in the right Fig. with the Pearson correlation coefficient, , per bin, which is  for all bins (ignoring the first two).<br><img alt="fit_R23.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/fit_r23.png"><img alt="corr_R23.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/corr_r23.png"><br>By contrast, when we employ the O3N2 calibrator, the fit is much worse and the correlation coefficients remains low .<br><img alt="OH_NO_model_cluster.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/oh_no_model_cluster.png"> <img alt="corr_O3N2.png" src="n_o-comparison/assets/imgs/corr_o3n2.png">]]></description><link>n_o-comparison/3.-large-scale-structure-effects.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">N_O comparison/3.
